# Quantum Thermochemistry Calculator 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/keceli/QTC.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/keceli/QTC)

QTC includes modules that integrates open babel with quantum chemistry calculations and generates NASA polynomials in different formats.

It depends on:
  * [Open Babel](http://openbabel.org/) for cheminformatics 
  * MOPAC, NWChem, Gaussian, Molpro for quantum chemistry calculations
  * [MESS](https://github.com/PACChem/MESS) for calculating partititon function
  * [RMG](https://github.com/ReactionMechanismGenerator/RMG-Py) for generating a species list important for combustion chemistry
  * PAC99, thermp for format conversions

## Installation
conda simplifies the installation process
If you don't have it you can install it without root privilages
```
wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
After the installation is completed you can install the dependencies with:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
Run qtc after activating qtc-env environment, i.e.
```
source activate qtc-env
```
Alternatively, you can install them with conda:
```
conda install numpy psutil
conda install -c openbabel openbabel
conda install -c mcs07 cirpy 
```
## Run QTC
```
python src/qtc.py -i O -k 'opt/mp2/dz/nwchem' -Q
```
